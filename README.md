The **BromA Framework** is a community effort made by the BromA group in order to establish a standard shared across all missions - which could then be customized by the content maker.

Since this could only be made thanks to shared scripts, missions and all sorts of knowledge, this project is entirely open-source and interested users are free to play with it as much as they want.

Also keeping up with good practices, most functionality is modular and therefore optional to the user: adding and disabling plugins from the mission is extremely easy.

The framework is as context agnostic as possible, meaning you can just change one value and your mission will change from a COOP into a TVT or even a COTVT - everything is already pre-configured to be flexible and as little as possible assumptions are made about the mission itself.
